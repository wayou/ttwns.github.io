There was a time when we both were still working for others. We wrote down some of our thoughts back then in order to encourage ourselves to get out of our dead-end jobs. (Words almost stay the same as they are first written, only some conjunctions added to make sentences read like a sequence.)

1. Coz mom said that she is jealous of her friends saying out loud that their sons are working for famous enterprises and taking them abroad for fun very often. And we are doing neither.
2. Cooperating with uncongenial people is killing us, especially the case when the one is our boss.
3. We do not accept rules set by others.
4. We are also not supposed to be limited by the abilities of other people.
5. We're tired of disguising ourselves as someone we're actually not.
6. But we don't consider ourselves better than others, though we do think we're different from them.
7. Why do we keep staying up late and not saving energy for tomorrow? "Coz there's nothing there to fight for."
8. We're sick of the days that we woke up aimlessly in the morning, got interrupted by insignificant bullshits every once in an hour, went to lunch 24/7(24/5) at 12:00 punctually, wandered around doing everything but important things, and thought hard at night about where exactly our energy went.
9. Rather than being stuck in a humdrum office, we see endless possibilities in front of us.
10. Knowing that the world is ruled by some selfish asses pissed us really off. We are destined to start a new world.

We all do things for a reason.
What's yours?
