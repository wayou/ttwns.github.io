So they say.

Three weeks ago [The Traveling Twins](http://ttwns.tw) took part in a contest held by a well-known multinational conglomerate company who makes smartphones. It was quite exhausting because most of the time we just sit there and wait, but also rewarding in terms of a two-week work for a one-month old company(we won a free smartphone & tablet home!).

We have to confess that we were not so serious about the contest (we suppose it's hard for a two-week work to be outstanding). But we were content with making [Gridy](http://ttwns.tw/gridy "Link to Gridy's website") possible. However, one of the judge was not so happy with it and even quote a line from *The Matrix Revolutions*, and said: "Every program has a purpose." We actually looked it up and [found](http://www.generationterrorists.com/quotes/the_matrix_revolutions.shtml) that the exact line was: "Every program that is created must have a purpose; if it does not, it is deleted." Thankfully they wasn't able to delete Gridy.

Some people believe in determinism. We, as far as we know about determinism, are actually two of its followers. They say that every program should have a purpose, and **The One** is destined to prevail; Human race is doomed, and I'm destined to love you. They say so not for a greater good, but for romanticism and box office, and they successfully cheated everyone and themselves, but not us.

A true determinist should care more about those lines like "Everything happens for a reason," or "Everything begins with choice," which appeared in the [*The Matrix Reloaded*](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Reloaded), than "There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose, for as we both know, without purpose we would not exist." Determinism is not so gloomy and dismal that we are all going to die in year 2012. On the contrary, determinism is about cause and effect. That I typed, so words showed. It's so hopeful that we could change the world in reality through our behavior. Believe me, a destined love would not be more cherish-worthy than an accidental love. What's so good about the fact that we're destined to meet? It's just a fact, and a dead one, without any possibility and opportunity. Life becomes meaningless under false determinism. So don’t be fooled by advitisers.

Back to our story. The judge didn't point at our head and say Gridy is pointless. He made a general speech to every contester. But still we firmly object to the idea that Gridy should be practical, useful, or purposeful. We do understand that as a judge for a game. One should put practicality in mind and score based on it. Yet, a useless knowledge named philosophy overthrown as many regimes beyond your imagination. A subject of no use called art enriches human being for centuries. There are things which need time to incubate. If we focus too much on the immediate interests instead of things per se, only God knows what we'll lose. Such that myopia, in our opinion, is lethal. Instead, one should act and think like a child.

> ...children flourish where adults fail.Their worldview is incomplete and demands discovery. They prosper because they embrace their ignorance instead of ignoring it. And they are willing to explore, investigate and put their ideas to the test because they are willing to fail. Unlike adults, they don’t care how other people perceive or evaluate their ideas, and they’re unconcerned with the impossible or what doesn’t work.

One of us used to want to be a philosopher. But our mom asked anxiously: "How do you live by that?" And his girlfriend also told him to [get a job (or life)](http://lyrics.wikia.com/Oasis:The_Importance_Of_Being_Idle). It was sad, but he knew at that moment that it must be approached differently. Because in a world that doesn't treasure some kind of knowledge anymore, we have to be creative and prove it in a innovative way.

Gridy will continue to grow. Maybe one day someone will find it useful in a mysterious way. We'll try to make a useful app next time, maybe. :p
