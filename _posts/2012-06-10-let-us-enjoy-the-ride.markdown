We've been questioned a lot recently about how long we are going to hang on here as entrepreneurs before we lose all our money and the faith of our families. I must say, that is never a proper question for us.

One would not say that she is going to sell her life before it's too late for a good price. Nor would she walk persistently toward south and finally discovers herself located in the north.

We know we're fortunate to be well-educated, well-fed, and well-treated. And Just because of that we would like to devote our lives to better the lives of others in a way we think is best and sustainable.

"Everything comes with a price." That's a fine quote for capitalism and for life. We paid the price ourselves so please let us enjoy the ride.

Life itself is a dead-end. Everyone who thought we were so foolish for stepping out on our own will be proven right. We will certainly fail. We will probably succeed. But there is no deadline. Coz it will cost us a lifetime.

**UPDATE: After we wrote this post, we found something similar to our thought which every entrepreneur should read (list keeps growing):**
